# FrontEnd

## Steps for local dev

1. `npm install`
2. `cd one-two-three`
3. `npm start`

## IDE extension

If you use VS Code as your IDE, I would recommend installing extension - Prettier
Please Open VS Code --> Preference --> Extensions, search for "Prettier" and install it.

Once it is installed, go to Preference --> Settings, search for "formatter", and change the settings to below

Also, don't forget to check your tab size and see if it is "2"

One more thing. In the Settings, search for "Prettier" and check the box of "Single Quote"
